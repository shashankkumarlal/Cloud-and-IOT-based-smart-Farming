# Cloud-and-IOT-based-smart-Farming
This IoT-based Smart Farming System monitors conditions using sensors and ESP8266, with data sent to Google Cloud for insights and control. It boosts productivity and reduces resource waste through automation.

#IoT-Based Smart Farming with Cloud Integration
#Description:
This project aims to create a smart farming system using IoT devices, cloud integration, and sensors to monitor and control various agricultural parameters remotely. By leveraging the ESP8266 microcontroller and sensors, this system collects data such as soil moisture, temperature, and distance, and uploads this data to the cloud using Google Cloud. This enables real-time monitoring and decision-making for optimal farming conditions, thus improving efficiency and crop management.

#Features:
Real-time monitoring: Continuously collects data from sensors and sends it to the cloud for live tracking.
Remote control: Allows for remote control of irrigation systems based on sensor data.
Sensor integration: Uses soil moisture sensor, ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement, and a temperature sensor to monitor environmental conditions.
Cloud Integration: Data is uploaded to Google Cloud for processing, storage, and visualization.
Alert System: Sends notifications (e.g., soil moisture levels are low) via cloud when certain thresholds are crossed.
Installation:
To replicate or run this project, follow these steps:

#Hardware Requirements:

ESP8266 microcontroller

#Connections:
Soil Moisture Sensor:

Connect the VCC pin of the soil moisture sensor to the 3.3V pin of the ESP8266.
Connect the GND pin of the soil moisture sensor to the GND pin of the ESP8266.
Connect the Analog Output (A0) pin of the soil moisture sensor to GPIO0 (A0) on the ESP8266.

Ultrasonic Sensor:

Connect the VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the 3.3V pin of the ESP8266.
Connect the GND pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the GND pin of the ESP8266.
Connect the Trigger (TRIG) pin of the ultrasonic sensor to GPIO14 (D5) on the ESP8266.
Connect the Echo (ECHO) pin of the ultrasonic sensor to GPIO12 (D6) on the ESP8266.

IR Sensor:

Connect the VCC pin of the IR sensor to the 3.3V pin of the ESP8266.
Connect the GND pin of the IR sensor to the GND pin of the ESP8266.
Connect the Signal (OUT) pin of the IR sensor to GPIO13 (D7) on the ESP8266.

#How the Code Works with the Connections:
The soil moisture sensor reads the moisture level and is connected to GPIO0 (A0), which is read by the ADC pin.
The ultrasonic sensor's trigger and echo pins are connected to GPIO14 (D5) and GPIO12 (D6), respectively, for measuring distance.
The IR sensor detects whether there is an object and is connected to GPIO13 (D7).
The relay, which controls the water pump, can be connected to another GPIO pin to activate the pump when the soil is dry.
